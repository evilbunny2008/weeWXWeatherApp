## weeWXWeatherApp -- A weather app for weeWX

Unlike general weather apps, which get data from third party websites, this app gets data from personal weather stations running weeWX.

This is a community maintained project that I do in my free time. While all efforts are taken to test everything works, in some cases things get overlooked. If you spot a problem please try to fix it and contribute where you can. If you aren't able to fix the issue, please file a bug under issues so we can track the progress and resolution of the problem.
